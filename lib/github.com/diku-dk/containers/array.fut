  -- of the need to make every value correspond to an index in some
  -- array it can instead correspond to a key. Here an array of
  -- `n`@term key `k`@term and value `v`@term pairs are given as an
  -- array. And every value with the same key will be reduced with an
  -- associative and commutative operator `op`@term, futhermore an
  -- neutral element `ne`@term must be given.

  -- equality `eq`@term. This implementation works much like
